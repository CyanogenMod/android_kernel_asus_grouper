config TEGRA_GRHOST
	tristate "Tegra graphics host driver"
	help
	  Driver for the Tegra graphics host hardware.

config TEGRA_GRHOST_USE_NVMAP
	bool "Use nvmap as graphics memory manager"
	default y
	help
	  Use nvmap as the graphics memory manager. This is the only
	  choice at the moment.

config TEGRA_GRHOST_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
	depends on TEGRA_GRHOST
	int "Default timeout for submits"
	default 0 if TEGRA_SIMULATION_PLATFORM
	default 30000
	help
	  Default timeout for jobs in milliseconds. Set to zero for no timeout.

config TEGRA_DC
	tristate "Tegra Display Contoller"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA && TEGRA_GRHOST
	select FB_MODE_HELPERS
	select I2C
	help
	  Tegra display controller support.

	select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select FB_CFB_COPYAREA

	help
	  Framebuffer device support for the Tegra display controller.

config TEGRA_DC_EXTENSIONS
	bool "Tegra Display Controller Extensions"
	depends on TEGRA_DC
	default y
	help
	  This exposes support for extended capabilities of the Tegra display
	  controller to userspace drivers.

config TEGRA_NVMAP
	bool "Tegra GPU memory management driver (nvmap)"
	select ARM_DMA_USE_IOMMU if IOMMU_API
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include the memory management driver for the Tegra
	  GPU, multimedia and display subsystems

config NVMAP_RECLAIM_UNPINNED_VM
	bool "Virtualize IOVMM memory in nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (TEGRA_IOVMM || IOMMU_API)
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable nvmap to reclaim I/O virtual memory after
	  it has been unpinned, and re-use it for other handles. This can
	  allow a larger virtual I/O VM space than would normally be
	  supported by the hardware, at a slight cost in performance.

config NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM
	bool "Allow physical system memory to be used by nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvmap to use physical system memory (i.e.,
	  shared with the operating system but not translated through
	  an IOVMM device) for allocations.

config NVMAP_HIGHMEM_ONLY
	bool "Use only HIGHMEM for nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM || TEGRA_IOVMM || IOMMU_API) && HIGHMEM
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to restrict nvmap system memory allocations (both
	  physical system memory and IOVMM) to just HIGHMEM pages.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_KILLER
	bool "Reclaim nvmap carveout by killing processes"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to reclaim carveout space by killing
	  processes. This will kill the largest consumers of lowest priority
	  first.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_COMPACTOR
	bool "Compact carveout when it gets fragmented"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  When carveout allocation attempt fails, compactor defragements
	  heap and retries the failed allocation.
	  Say Y here to let nvmap to keep carveout fragmentation under control.

config NVMAP_PAGE_POOLS
	bool "Use page pools to reduce allocation overhead"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  say Y here to reduce the alloction overhead, which is significant
	  for uncached, writecombine and inner cacheable memories as it
	  involves changing page attributes during every allocation per page
	  and flushing cache. Alloc time is reduced by allcoating the pages
	  ahead and keeping them aside. The reserved pages would be released
	  when system is low on memory and acquired back during release of
	  memory.

config NVMAP_PAGE_POOL_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x0

config NVMAP_CACHE_MAINT_BY_SET_WAYS
	bool "Enable cache maintenance by set/ways"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	 Say Y here to reduce cache maintenance overhead by MVA.
	 This helps in reducing cache maintenance overhead in the systems,
	 where inner cache includes only L1. For the systems, where inner cache
	 includes L1 and L2, keep this option disabled.

config NVMAP_OUTER_CACHE_MAINT_BY_SET_WAYS
	bool "Enable outer cache maintenance by set/ways"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to optimize cache maintenance for ranges
	  bigger than size of outer cache. This option has no effect on
	  system without outer cache.

config NVMAP_VPR
	bool "Enable VPR Heap."
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable Video Protection Region(VPR) heap.
	  if unsure, say N.

config NVMAP_FORCE_ZEROED_USER_PAGES
	bool "Only alloc zeroed pages for user space"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	help
	  Say Y here to force zeroing of pages allocated for user space. This
	  avoids leaking kernel secure data to user space. This can add
	  significant overhead to allocation operations depending on the
	  allocation size requested.

config TEGRA_DSI
	bool "Enable DSI panel."
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the DSI panel.

config NVMAP_CONVERT_CARVEOUT_TO_IOVMM
	bool "Convert carveout to IOVMM"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP &&  (TEGRA_IOVMM_SMMU || IOMMU_API)
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to force to convert carveout memory requests to
	  I/O virtual memory requests.

config TEGRA_NVHDCP
	bool "Support NVHDCP content protection on HDMI"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to support NVHDCP upstream and downstream protocols, this
	  requires a correctly fused chip to negotiate keys.

config TEGRA_HDMI_74MHZ_LIMIT
	bool "Support only up to 74.25 MHz HDMI pixel frequency"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to make kernel report only low bandwidth modes.
	  Useful only for boards which can't deliver 148.50 MHz.
